**AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle)**:\
AGVs are transport vehicles in a logistics context. They can execute tasks automatically but have limited onboard sensors and capabilities. Because of these limitations AGVs have to be guided by a physical marks like coloured lines or magnetic lines on the ground.

**AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot)**:\
AMRs are transport vehicles in a logistics context. They have extended onboard sensors and capabilites that enable autonomous path finding and evasion and also autonomous execution of tasks. (See [Autonomous Mobile Robot](../../applications/docs/optimaflow/amr_agv.md#autonomous-mobile-robot-amr))
