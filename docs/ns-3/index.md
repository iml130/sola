# Integration into ns-3

> ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use. The goal of the ns-3 project is to develop a preferred, open simulation environment for networking research: it should be aligned with the simulation needs of modern networking research and should encourage community contribution, peer review, and validation of the software.

Our DAISI application runs on top of the [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) network simulator and simulates the chosen scenario in an environment.
