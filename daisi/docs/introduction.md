# Introduction

# What is ns-3
> ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use. The goal of the ns-3 project is to develop a preferred, open simulation environment for networking research: it should be aligned with the simulation needs of modern networking research and should encourage community contribution, peer review, and validation of the software.

Our application runs on top of the [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) network simulator and simulates the chosen scenario in an environment.
