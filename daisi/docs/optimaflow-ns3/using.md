## Quickstart

- `cpps`
    - `./daisi_exec --environment=cpps --scenario=daisi/scenarios/cpps/default.yml`

Each example command assumes that the simulation executable is located in the main folder, but can of course be adapted to other names and locations.
The default location is `build/daisi/src/main/Main`.
As shown, the environment for a simulation run can be selected with the `environment` parameter.
Additionally, a scenario has to be defined with the `scenario` parameter.

## Szenarios

### Create new szenarios

## Run it

- `cpps`
    - `./daisi_exec --environment=cpps --scenario=daisi/scenarios/cpps/default.yml`

- command
    - `./daisi_exec`
    - `--environment`
    - `--scenario`
        - scenario from file
        - scenario from command line
