# About

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the current ongoing fourth industrial revolution. Key-pillars of the I4.0 are interconnectivity, information transparency, decentralized decision-making, and technical assistance.

Interconnectivity means that a wide variety of machines, sensors and devices can communicate and interact with each other. Standardized interfaces are used for this purpose. Through the aforementioned interconnectitivy, the real world is unified with the virtual world. Exchanged information can be put into context. Context-related information is the basis for further decision-making. Decentralized decision-making is based on networking and information transparency. Local information is linked with global information. Participants act on this aggregated information. Technical assistence ensures that the increasingly complex processes remain manageable. This support is particularly important for humans, since their role as machine operators is evolving into that of problem solvers.

We are using ns-3, a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems. ns-3 is targeting primarily research and educational purpose. However, we are using it for the development of I4.0 application and communication technologies.

## MkDocs - Project Documentation

Currenlty our project documentation is written with Markdown.

```bash
pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Afer installing, just run the mkdocs:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
