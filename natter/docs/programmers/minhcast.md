A multicast operation in distributed systems enables an initial sender to send data to multiple receivers, also know as an application-level multicast.
MINHCAST exposes information of the structured overlay MINHTON to disseminate information to its neighbors.
Contrary to other approaches such as gossiping or epidemic, MINHCAST does not set up explicit communication paths and requires no additional communication overhead.

Further information on the MINHCAST protocol will follow soon.
