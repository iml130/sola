# Introduction

## Getting started

To run OptiMaFlow please download and build the repository as described [here](../../docs/getting_started.md).
Afterwards follow the instructions for [OptiMaFlow](../../daisi/docs/optimaflow-ns3/introduction.md) in the ns3-Integration tab.

### Intralogistics

Industry 4.0 (I4.0), the fourth industrial revolution, is the unification of the physical (hardware) world with cyber-applications (software) [[1]](#references).
New technologies and applications emerge in the intelligent manufacturing environment, also known as smart factories or cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) [[2]](#references).
These I4.0-scenarios are built on the design principles such as interconnectivity, information transparency (open interfaces and standards), decentralized decision-making, and technical assistance [[3]](#references).
For instance, a production order (PO) becomes digital and gains access to information of all devices and services of the CPPS.
